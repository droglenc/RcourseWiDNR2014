Attendees will have the opportunity to gain experience with two software packages (Image Pro and Nikon Elements) available for obtaining and analyzing images of calcified structures.  There will also be seminars and group discussions related to methods for evaluation precision of age estimates, effective sampling design, estimating growth and mortality rates, describing recruitment from catch at age data, and statistical tests used to compare metrics derived from age data.
